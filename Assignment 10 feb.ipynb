    "# Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",

    "The open function is used to open a file in Python. \n",
    "It takes the name of the file and an optional mode argument that specifies how the file should be opened. \n",
    "Here are the different modes for opening a file in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "    'r' (read mode) - This is the default mode and is used to read an existing file. \n",
    "    The file must already exist, otherwise, an error will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "    'w' (write mode) - This mode is used to create a new file or overwrite an existing file. \n",
    "    If the file already exists, its contents will be deleted and replaced with the new data. \n",
    "    If the file doesn't exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "    'a' (append mode) - This mode is used to append data to an existing file.\n",
    "    If the file already exists, the data will be written to the end of the file.\n",
    "    If the file doesn't exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "    'x' (exclusive creation mode) - This mode is used to create a new file.\n",
    "    If the file already exists, an error will be raised. This mode is used to prevent the accidental overwriting of an existing file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    'b' (binary mode) - This mode is used to open a binary file.\n",
    "    It can be combined with any of the above modes, for example 'rb' for reading a binary file or 'wb' for writing a binary file."
