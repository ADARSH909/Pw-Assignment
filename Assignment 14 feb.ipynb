    "resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used in Python when we need to perform multiple tasks simultaneously or when we want to take advantage of multiple cores\n",

    "The threading module is used to handle threads in Python. This module provides a way to create and manage threads in a Python program.\n",

    "State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Improved performance: Multithreading can improve the performance of a program by utilizing multiple cores in a CPU \n",
    "    and reducing the waiting time for I/O operations. This can result in faster execution of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Increased responsiveness: Multithreading can make a program more responsive by allowing it to continue processing user \n",
    "    input while it is executing time-consuming tasks in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Resource sharing: Multithreading allows multiple threads to share resources such as memory, files, and network connections,\n",
    "    which can result in more efficient use of system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Modularity: Multithreading allows the program to be organized into smaller, more manageable parts. Each thread can be\n",
    "    responsible for a specific task, making the program easier to design, implement, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Complexity: Multithreading can make a program more complex to design, implement, and debug. The interactions between \n",
    "    threads can be difficult to manage, and it can be hard to ensure that the program behaves as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Synchronization: Multithreading requires synchronization between threads to ensure that shared resources are accessed \n",
    "    in a consistent and safe manner. This can add overhead to the program and increase the risk of deadlocks or race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Resource contention: Multithreading can lead to resource contention if multiple threads try to access the same resource at\n",
    "    the same time. This can result in slower execution and increased overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Debugging: Debugging multithreaded programs can be more difficult, as the interactions between threads can be hard to trace \n",
    "    and reproduce."

    " Explain deadlocks and race conditions\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    Deadlock:\n",
    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked, waiting for each other to release resources that they need to proceed. \n",
    "This can happen when multiple threads try to acquire the same resources in a different order, or when one thread acquires a \n",
    "resource and then waits for another resource that is held by a different thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider two threads, A and B, that need to access two resources, X and Y, in the following order: A needs to \n",
    "acquire X and then Y, while B needs to acquire Y and then X. If A acquires X and then waits for Y, and B acquires Y and then \n",
    "waits for X, a deadlock occurs because neither thread can proceed without releasing the resource that the other thread is waiting for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks can be difficult to detect and debug, and can lead to a program that appears to be frozen or unresponsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Condition:\n",
    "A race condition occurs when two or more threads access a shared resource in an unpredictable order, which can lead to\n",
    "unexpected or incorrect results. Race conditions occur when the order of access to the shared resource is not controlled\n",
    "or synchronized properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider two threads, A and B, that both access a shared variable x. If both threads read the value of x, modify \n",
    "it, and then write it back, the final value of x depends on the order in which the threads execute. If thread A reads x first,\n",
    "modifies it, and then writes it back, and thread B does the same thing, the final value of x will depend on the order in which \n",
    "the threads executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions can be difficult to detect and reproduce, and can lead to subtle bugs and unpredictable behavior in the program."
