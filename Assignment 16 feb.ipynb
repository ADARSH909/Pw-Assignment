    "What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases\n",
    "Ans:A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and organized in a way that enables efficient retrieval and manipulation of that data. \n",
    "Databases are used in a wide range of applications, from managing customer data in business to storing scientific data in research.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL databases are two types of databases that differ in their approach to storing and retrieving data. SQL (Structured Query Language) is\n",
    "a relational database management system that uses a structured approach to organizing data. Data in an SQL database is organized into tables, with\n",
    "each table representing a different type of entity (such as customers or orders) and each row in the table representing a specific instance of that\n",
    "entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, do not use a structured approach to organizing data. Instead, data is stored in a variety of formats, including \n",
    "key-value stores, document stores, and graph databases. NoSQL databases are often used for large-scale applications that require high performance \n",
    "and scalability, as they can handle a large volume of data and can be easily distributed across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SQL databases use a structured approach to organizing data, while NoSQL databases do not.\n",
    "    SQL databases are relational, while NoSQL databases are non-relational.\n",

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, and it is a category of SQL statements used to define, modify, and manage the structure of a database.\n",
    "DDL statements are used to create, modify, or delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints.\n",

    "Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Primary Key and Foreign Key are important concepts in relational databases that help establish relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Primary Key: A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. It is used\n",
    "    to enforce data integrity and ensure that each row in the table can be uniquely identified. Primary keys are usually defined when \n",
    "    the table is created and they cannot be null. Each table can have only one primary key, which can be a single column or a combination of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a \"customers\" table. The \"id\" column in this table can be used as the primary key because each customer has\n",
    "a unique \"id\" that can be used to uniquely identify them. The primary key is usually used as a reference by other tables that establish \n",
    "relationships with the current table.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used \n",
    "    to establish a relationship between two tables and enforce referential integrity. Foreign keys are used to ensure that data in one\n",
    "    table is related to data in another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider an \"orders\" table that has a foreign key \"customer_id\" that refers to the \"id\" column in the \"customers\" table.\n",
    "This relationship ensures that each order in the \"orders\" table is associated with a customer in the \"customers\" table. The foreign key \n",
