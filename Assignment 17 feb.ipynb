    "What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database system that is designed for storing, retrieving and managing large amounts of unstructured data.\n",
    "In MongoDB, data is stored in a flexible document format called BSON, which is a binary representation of JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional relational model of tables with rows and columns.\n",
    "Instead, they use a variety of data models, including document-oriented, key-value, column-family, and graph-based models, to store and manage data. \n",
    "Non-relational databases are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data and are highly scalable and flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several scenarios where MongoDB may be preferred over SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data: MongoDB is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data,\n",
    "    making it an ideal choice for applications that generate a lot of data that does not fit neatly into tables and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "    High availability and scalability: MongoDB is designed to provide high availability and scalability, making it a good choice for applications\n",
    "    that require a large amount of data to be stored and processed quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Agile development: MongoDB's flexible schema makes it well-suited for agile development and rapid prototyping. Changes to the data model can\n",
    "    be made quickly and easily, without the need for complex database schema migrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Real-time analytics: MongoDB's rich query language and support for real-time data aggregation make it a good choice for applications that \n",
    "    require real-time analytics, such as those in the financial, healthcare, and IoT industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cloud-native applications: MongoDB is designed to be cloud-native, making it a good choice for applications that are deployed in the cloud \n",
    "    and require high availability, scalability, and flexibility."

    "State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    Document-oriented: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means that data is stored as flexible, JSON-like documents \n",
    "    instead of tables with rows and columns. This allows for greater flexibility and easier data modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Schema-less: MongoDB is a schema-less database, which means that there is no predefined schema for the data. This allows for\n",
    "    greater flexibility in data modeling and makes it easier to make changes to the data model as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Indexing: MongoDB supports indexing of fields in documents, which makes it easier and faster to search and retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Aggregation: MongoDB supports a powerful aggregation framework that allows for real-time analysis of data and aggregation of \n",
    "    data across multiple collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "    High availability and scalability: MongoDB is designed to provide high availability and scalability, with built-in replication \n",
    "    and sharding features that allow for automatic failover and load balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Security: MongoDB supports authentication and authorization, as well as encryption of data in transit and at rest, making it a \n",
    "    secure choice for storing sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Integration with other tools: MongoDB integrates with a wide range of other tools and technologies, including popular programming\n",
    "    languages like Python and Java, as well as data visualization and analytics tools like Tableau and Power BI.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cloud-native: MongoDB is designed to be cloud-native, with features like automatic provisioning, scaling, and backup in popular \n",
    "    cloud platforms like AWS and Azure."
