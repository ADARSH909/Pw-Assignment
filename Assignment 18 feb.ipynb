    " What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life\n",

    "The restaurant's servers may have their own API that allows them to communicate with the payment processor to process the payment."

    "Easier integration: APIs provide a standardized way for different applications to communicate with each other, which makes it easier to \n",

    "\n",
    "Increased efficiency: APIs can reduce development time and costs by allowing developers to use pre-built functionality rather than developing \n",
    "everything from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved user experience: By using APIs, applications can provide a more seamless and integrated experience for users by leveraging the\n",
    "functionality and data of other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhanced innovation: APIs can enable developers to build new applications and services by providing access to a wide range of functionality \n",
    "and data from other applications and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of using API:\n",

    "Security risks: APIs can expose sensitive data and functionality to third-party applications, which can create security risks if not properly \n",

    "\n",
    "Dependence on third-party APIs: If an application relies heavily on third-party APIs, any changes or disruptions to those APIs can impact the\n",

    "Complexity: APIs can be complex to work with, especially for non-technical users, which can make it more difficult to use and understand.\n",

    " What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.\n",

    "Communication Protocol: While all APIs allow applications to communicate with each other, Web APIs specifically use web protocols such\n",
    "as HTTP and HTTPS for communication.\n",

    " Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) are two popular architectural styles for building web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is a style of web architecture that is based on HTTP protocol. It emphasizes simple, lightweight, and scalable communication between web\n",
    "services, and it is typically used to build web services that expose data and functionality to other applications. RESTful web services use \n",
    "standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources and typically return data in a format like JSON or XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP, on the other hand, is a protocol that uses XML to exchange data between web services. It is a message-based protocol that provides more\n",
    "features and flexibility than REST, including support for transactions, security, and reliability. SOAP typically uses XML-based message format\n",
    "and defines a set of rules for exchanging messages over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the shortcomings of SOAP include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: SOAP is more complex than REST and requires more resources to process requests and responses. This can make it more difficult to \n",
    "implement and maintain compared to REST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance: Because SOAP messages are larger than REST messages due to their XML format, SOAP can be slower than REST, especially for large\n",
    "data transfers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: SOAP is less scalable than REST, which can limit its use in high traffic applications or for large data transfers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Poor caching: SOAP messages cannot be easily cached, which can limit the ability to improve performance through caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited language support: While SOAP can be used with many different programming languages, it is typically used with Java and .NET, \n",
    "which can limit its use with other languages and platforms."
