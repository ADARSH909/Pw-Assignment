    "What is Statistics?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.\n",
    "It involves using mathematical methods and models to draw inferences and conclusions about populations based on sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statisticians use a variety of tools and techniques to analyze data, including descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, hypothesis testing,\n",
    "regression analysis, and Bayesian analysis. These methods can be used to study a wide range of phenomena, including social and economic trends,\n",
    "medical research, climate patterns, and many other fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics plays an important role in many areas of modern society, including business, government, healthcare, education, and scientific research.\n",
    "It helps decision-makers to make informed choices by providing quantitative insights into complex problems and identifying patterns and trends in data."

    "Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "There are two main types of statistics: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Descriptive statistics: This type of statistics involves the collection, organization, and summarization of data. Descriptive \n",
    "    statistics provides a way to describe and summarize data sets in a meaningful way. The measures of central tendency, such as mean,\n",
    "    median, and mode, and measures of variability, such as range and standard deviation, are some of the commonly used descriptive statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A company may use descriptive statistics to understand the average income of their customers, the distribution of ages of their\n",
    "customers, and the most commonly purchased items from their store.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inferential statistics: This type of statistics involves making inferences about a population based on a sample of data. Inferential \n",
    "    statistics use probability theory and sampling techniques to make conclusions about a population based on a sample. It involves testing \n",
    "    hypotheses and making predictions based on the results of the sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A medical researcher may use inferential statistics to test whether a new drug is effective in treating a disease by randomly selecting\n",
    "a sample of patients and comparing the results of the treatment group with a control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both descriptive and inferential statistics are used in various fields, and they can be complementary in providing insights into complex phenomena.\n"

    "    (such as low, medium, and high income).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Interval data: This type of data has equal intervals between values, but there is no true zero point. Interval data can be used for numerical \n",

    "    between 0째C and 10째C is the same as the difference between 20째C and 30째C.\n",

    "    Ratio data: This type of data has equal intervals between values and a true zero point. Ratio data can be used for numerical measurements such\n",

    "Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an\n",

    "Ans:\n",
